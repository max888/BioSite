              <p>I am a graduate of General Assembly's Web Immersive programme that trains full stack web developers.  I used to work in Business Development - so I know how to talk, listen and learn what people want from a web product. It helps me manage expectations and I always strive to over deliver.</p>

            <p>Here is some of the stuff I have done. Not all of it is hosted but all is available on my <a href="https://github.com/max888">github account</a>. You can browse my code there and see what you think.</p>
            <h3>DK Trip Planner</h3>
            <a href="http://dktripplanner.com/">www.dktripplanner.com</a>
            <p>3 month internship after graduating from General Assembly. I worked on the Trip Planner app (http://dktripplanner.com/) as part of the web solutions team. DK Trip Planner is a HTML5 single page application built in BackboneJS and used Brunch.io to compile the front end.</p>

            <p>Working in 2 week sprints, my responsibilities included work on styling and functional changes requested by the editorial team and those outlined in JIRA by our product manager. I helped implement Drupal as a CMS where Google Docs had previously been used.</p>
            <h3>Stranded Travel</h3>
            <a href="http://www.strandedtravel.com">www.strandedtravel.com</a>
            <p>Stranded Travel is a personal project of mine and the biggest to date. It is a travel guide aimed at the younger traveller who is looking for the best places to eat, sleep, party and explore in different cities. I created it with the idea of striking a balance between inspiration and information.</p>
            <p>It was built with Ruby on Rails and uses javascript and jQuery to provide a more interactive experience for the user. I am using the Instagram, Twitter and Google Maps API's to provide information that is pulled in from the city name and GPS co-ordinates.</p>
            <h3>Real Talk</h3>
            <a href="http://realtalk-wdi.herokuapp.com/">realtalk-wdi.herokuapp.com</a>
            <p>Real Talk was a team hackathon project produced by myself and 3 other team mates un under 24 hours. It was a fun project that can take a picture of the user with their webcam and they can send self destructing messages, snap chat style. It is built on Sinatra and uses Photobooth jQuery plugin to access the users webcam (with permission of course!). It is a bit buggy but we wanted to preserve it in the original 24hour state.</p>
            <h3>Getaway Visuals</h3>
            <a href="http://www.getaway.maxcreates.com/">getaway.maxcreates.com</a>
            <p>A small project I have used to experiment with twitter Bootstrap front end framework. Just the homepage at this stage for a fictional digital agency. Design is responsive and mobile friendly.</p>
            <h3>Portfolio Site</h3>
            <a href="http://max888.github.io/maxnortondev/">portfolio.maxcreates.com</a>
            <p>I quickly created this site to show prospective employers that I have a good foundation in HTML/CSS/Javascript. It was created from scratch without using any frameworks or templates. All code is my own. I'm looking for a position as a junior developer.</p>
